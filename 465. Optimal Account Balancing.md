## Statement

```
You are given an array of transactions transactions where transactions[i] = [fromi, toi, amounti] indicates that the person with ID = fromi gave amounti $ to the person with ID = toi.

Return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.

 

Example 1:

Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[2,0,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
Example 2:

Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[1,0,1],[1,2,5],[2,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
 

Constraints:

1 <= transactions.length <= 8
transactions[i].length == 3
0 <= fromi, toi < 12
fromi != toi
1 <= amounti <= 100
```


## Solution

 ```
 With all the given transactions, in the end, each person with ID = id will have an overall balance bal[id]. Note that the id value or any person coincidentally with 0 balance is irrelevant to debt settling count, so we can simply use an array debt[] to store all non-zero balances, where

debt[i] > 0 means a person needs to pay $ debt[i] to other person(s);
debt[i] < 0 means a person needs to collect $ debt[i] back from other person(s).
Starting from first debt debt[0], we look for all other debts debt[i] (i>0) which have opposite sign to debt[0]. Then each such debt[i] can make one transaction debt[i] += debt[0] to clear the person with debt debt[0]. From now on, the person with debt debt[0] is dropped out of the problem and we recursively drop persons one by one until everyone's debt is cleared meanwhile updating the minimum number of transactions during DFS.

public:
    vector<int>debts;
    
    int dfs(int start){
        
        int minOps = INT_MAX;
        while(start < int(debts.size()) && !debts[start]) start++;
        
        for(int i = start + 1;i<int(debts.size());i++){
            if(debts[i] * debts[start] < 0){
                debts[i] += debts[start];
                minOps = min(minOps, 1 + dfs(start + 1));
                debts[i] -= debts[start];
            }
        }
        
        return minOps == INT_MAX ? 0 : minOps;
        
    }
    
    int minTransfers(vector<vector<int>>& transactions) {
        
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        
        for(auto &t : transactions){
            int lender = t[0], borrower = t[1], amount = t[2];
            mp[lender] -= amount;
            mp[borrower] += amount;
        }
        
        for(auto it : mp){
            if(it.second) debts.push_back(it.second);
        }
        
        sort(debts.begin(), debts.end());
        
        return dfs(0);
        
    }

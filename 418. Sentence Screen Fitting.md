## Statement

```
Given a rows x cols screen and a sentence represented as a list of strings, return the number of times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen.

The order of words in the sentence must remain unchanged, and a word cannot be split into two lines. A single space must separate two consecutive words in a line.

 

Example 1:

Input: sentence = ["hello","world"], rows = 2, cols = 8
Output: 1
Explanation:
hello---
world---
The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
Example 2:

Input: sentence = ["a", "bcd", "e"], rows = 3, cols = 6
Output: 2
Explanation:
a-bcd- 
e-a---
bcd-e-
The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
Example 3:

Input: sentence = ["i","had","apple","pie"], rows = 4, cols = 5
Output: 1
Explanation:
i-had
apple
pie-i
had--
The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
 

Constraints:

1 <= sentence.length <= 100
1 <= sentence[i].length <= 10
sentence[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
1 <= rows, cols <= 2 * 104
```

## Solution

I use num to represent how many words can be put in the screen. we use a map<i, cnt> to record for each line how many words cnt can be put when starting with word i. So when we scan each line of the screen, we first get the starting word should be put on this line. If this starting words is already in the map, then just read it; otherwise, create a new entry in this map.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int wordsTyping(vector<string>& sentence, int rows, int cols) {
        int n = sentence.size();
        vector<int>mp(n, -1);
        int num = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<rows;i++){
            int start = num%n;
            if(mp[start] == -1){
                int cnt = 0, len = 0;
                for(int j = start;len<cols;j = (j + 1)%n, cnt++){
                    if(len + sentence[j].size() > cols) break;
                    len += sentence[j].size() + 1;
                }
                num += cnt;
                mp[start] = cnt;
            }
            else num += mp[start];
        }
        return num / n;
    }
};
```

```
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
Output: 4


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109

```


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int closestValue(TreeNode* root, double target) {
        int closest = root->val;
        while(root != NULL){
            closest = abs(root->val - target) < abs(closest - target) ? root->val : closest;
            root = target < root->val ? root->left : root->right;
        }
        return closest;
    }
};
```
